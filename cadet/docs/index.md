# Ergonomic Space Cadet

Space Cadet keyboard permitted to input more than 8000 different characters, including greek alphabet, mathematical characters, APL characters, and various symbols. Most modern input systems won't allow such flexibility so easily.

But, modern Linux systems actually have the mechanisms which would permit the user achieve comparable feats.

This project is aimed at achieving the same power as Space Cadet had using modern Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.

1. I personally am fond of these keyboards; after typing on them for a while, it is hard to switch back to normal models.

2. The keyboards have a lot of extra keys and buttons which can be customized.

3. I have Microsoft Natural 4000 and Microsoft Ergonomic Desktop, - so these are the models I am targeting at.

I will follow a number of principles.

1. Key combinations are considered harmful. Latch sequences are preferred at all times.

2. The command sequences should be logical and easily rememberable. They also should be easily accessible on the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard.

3. The testing is performed in Ubuntu Linux environment, with i3 window manager. All modifications are highly relevant to that environment.

4. I am extensively using the numpad to enter numerical sequences.

5. Language switching must be stateless. Bilingual users are performing the language switching operation extremely often, thus the operation should be very fast, with each language ideally mapped to its own key in the front row of the keyboard.

It seems this will require several modifiers for a typical bilingual user.

1. Language: English

2. Language: Native (say, Russian)

3. AltGr

4. Compose

I do not list the window manager key, because quite naturally that's the Win key.
